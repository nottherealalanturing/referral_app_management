## Ahmed

1. I've added Font Awesome icon links to the `<head>` section of `index.html`. For consistency let's use the `fa-solid` class for icons to match Assad's previous work.
2. The previous favicon was was shrunk so I updated it
3. I added the screen breakpoints in the `global.css` file


TODO -
page padding
Add a readme.md file with project description
hide the navigation in table and mobile screen when a nav-link is clicked
